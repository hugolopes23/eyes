# Project Title: eyes

# Description of Project:
This project worked on manipulating styles using JavaScript and CSS. The webpage displays two eyes that will track the mouse and appear as if they are looking at it.

# How to Run:
Download the repo zip. Once you have the files downloaded open eyes.html in your browser.

# Roadmap to Future Improvements:
I would like to add a button that adds more eyes to the screen that also follow the mouse.
